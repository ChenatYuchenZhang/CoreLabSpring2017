VENTURE DESIGN

“An approach to leveraging design into new businesses, from zero through launch.”

Business Model:
	-Value Proposition
	-Who is this for?
	-Use Case Themes

Launch fast, learn in the wild

TRANSIENT ADVANTAGE:
Launch many ventures consecutively
	-building and exploiting many ventures at once


WE HAVE TO BE BOTH:

Playing not to lose: Existing ventures
  -Human-Centered Design
  -Build within the core
  -Near-term performance
  -Stability at stake
  -Defensive stance
  -Limiting failure

Playing to win: Future ventures
  -Venture Design
  -Build beyond the core
  -Future performance
  -Growth at stake
  -Offensive stance
  -Maximizing breakthrough

Horizon 1 Growth: Defend and Extend Core Business
	-Playing not to lose
	-Do what you know will work
	-(Bottom Left Corner)
Horizon 2 Growth: Build Incremental new Businesses
	-Playing to win
	-Building new things and taking risks, but not extending far 			from existing business
	-(Middle Three)
Horizon 3 Growth: Create Disruptive New Businesses
	-Playing to win
	-Going all in on a new idea
	-May involve doing something that is discontinuous of existing 			business
	-Must envision future state, then work backwards to chart course
	-(Top Right Corner)


Key Success Factors
1. Independence
2. Collaboration
3. Speed
4. Focus

PRINCIPLES OF VENTURE DESIGN:
1. Grant and Defend Autonomy
2. Drive Continuous Engagement
3. Prioritize Progress Over Process
4. Design the Impact not the Product

Impacts of Venture Design:
  -Purpose
  -Strategy
  -Brand
  -Product
  -Awareness
  -Sales
  -Funding
  -Organizational Development

BEWARE:
  -Paradox of Growth:
	-“Growth creates complexity and yet complexity is the number one 	killer of profitable growth”


Working Collaborative Between Two Companies:
  Ground Rules:
	-Provided Right-Of-Way
	-Empowered to Run Independently
	-Own Definitions and Metrics of Success
	-On-Site Engagement from Key Leaders
	-Open Door Innovation Environment
	-Own Set of Commercialization Models


GRANT AND DEFEND AUTONOMY:
  -“New ventures thrive when provided the freedom and agency to continually shape their own best practices, unencumbered by organizational history, politics, or legacy systems.”

Exploitative Business - Typical of Large Businesses
  -Strategic Intent: Profit
  -Competencies: Operational
  -Culture: Efficiency, quality, risk mitigation
  -Leadership: Authoritative, hierarchical
  -Structure: Formal, procedural
  -Critical Tasks: Operations, optimization, incremental innovation
  -Success Metrics: Margins, return on investment

Explorative Business - Typical of New Ventures
  -Strategic Intent: Innovation, growth
  -Competencies: Entrepreneurial
  -Speed, flexibility, experimentation, risk taking
  -Leadership: Visionary, flat
  -Structure: Informal, adaptive
  -Critical Tasks: New products, adaptability, breakthrough innovation
  -Success Metrics: Growth, milestones

FIVE DEGREES OF RISK:
1. Freedom to Fail
2. Freedom to Act
3. Freedom to Organize and Reorganize
4. Freedom to Operate
5. Freedom to Attack

Better to self-disrupt than be taken out by a competitor at the knees


DRIVE CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT:
  -“Emphasize deep collaboration, transparent work flows, and flat teams to gain efficiency, continuity, and capability across all contributors. Cumulatively this enables the “founder’s mindset” of co-ownership and emphasis on impact.

Development Process:
1. Discover
  -Analysis becomes insights
2. Design
  -Insights become concepts
3. Deliver
  -Concepts become products

Benefits of Continuous Engagement:
  -Improves Efficiency
  -Drives Continuity
  -Enables Capability Development
  -Encourages Founder’s Mindset
	-Deep understanding of the venture

Communicate Continuously
Workshops & Collaboration Sessions
Immersion & Collocation


PRIORITIZE PROGRESS OVER PROCESS:
  -“Rather than adhering to a rigid process, seek and exploit opportunities to move further faster. New venture teams should jump ahead whenever possible.” 

-Eliminate distracting options
-Surface ideas early
-Preview challenges
-Gain alignment

Lean Iteration Process:
1. Have an idea
2. Build a prototype
3. Test with a research sprint
4. Repeat as necessary

Impatient Design Process:
1. Prototype, then research (not the inverse)
2. Write the press release
3. Give the sales pitch 
4. Storyboard crowdfunding video


DESIGN THE IMPACT, NOT THE PRODUCT
  -“Define and work toward clear business objectives, focusing on what is necessary and sufficient for success. The required impact is the constant, and how it’s achieved it is the variable — not the other way around.”
